# FStd
FStd aka. Flamin's Std is a collection of utilities i wrote for that i felt was really lacking within zig's standard library

## What this project is not.
This project is not a replacement for the standard libray.
    `FStd is a complementary library that you should use along with the standard library`
It is not a standalone library. It is very dependent on the zig standard library.
    `This means it might break in the future depending on how zig evovles in the future`

## What does this libray contain
Currently the library contains a Async Runtime called `Kyoto` inspired by Rust's Tokio
And it implements Async using Futures. Futures are really well documented through the rust docs. 
You can read them [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/future/trait.Future.html)
or you can use [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises).

Kyoto is currently in a unfinished state
Features:
    [x] Basic Scheduling of Futures
    [x] Future Chaining
    [x] Sleep
    [ ] Using epoll to wait for file descriptors (Might be out of scope)
    [ ] Awaiting futures within a future. (Future suspending. Would require being able to access the future within the poll function. and maybe a macro to convert the types around)
    [ ] Turning a list of futures into a future of a list aka. [sequenceA](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.21.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#v:sequenceA)

## Contributing
Currently I'm the only person working on FStd as its mostly a personal project. However feel free to make bug reports or make pull requests if you'd like, If you want to contribute code then first make a issue with what you'd like to do. I don't want to waste your time by rejecting pull requests because it doesnt align with my vision of the project. It doesnt stop you from forking the project and making changes, as long as its within the license.

I will reject pull requests and issues where the vast majority of the content is generated by LLMs. LLMs live in a very gray area legally speaking, so i'd prefer not having any code written by LLMs in my project and issues are a waste of everyone's time, see [here](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2024/01/02/the-i-in-llm-stands-for-intelligence/).
